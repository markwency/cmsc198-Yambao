# June Week 1

## Todo

- Create a web application for a job fair event. It takes information from the attendees and saves it in the database. Web application should run in a localhost. Use php.
- Use MVC, Fat-Free Framework, AJAX, and JSON to the web application created for the job fair event. Should still run in the localhost and can save in database.
- Create a program that deletes "malicious" files from a USB when said device is plugged. File extensions such as .sh, .ini, .dll, .bat should be removed from the device. Any programming language can be used.
- Create a new layout for the OSA website (static). Make it as responsive as possible.

## Done

- Finished the web application for the job fair event. I programmed in php and javascript to connect and save informations to the database. I used WAMP for the web server and phpMyAdmin for the database. Hours Finished: 7
- Finished the Fat-Free Framework and MVC version of the web application for the job fair event. I used the F3 Framework, AJAX, and JSON to connect and save informations to the database. Also used WAMP for the web server and phpMyAdmin for the database. Hours Finished: 7
- Created a program in C programming that recursively checks the extensions of files in a directory and its subdirectories. It then removes files that is .sh, .bat, .ini and .dll and reports how many files where deleted. Used dirent.h. Hours Finished: 2
- Designed and implemented a new header, navigation bar, and footer for the OSA website. Used Materialize framework and made sure everything is responsive. I also utilized javascript animations for added effects. Hours Finished: 14

## To be done

- Make the C program also run automatically when a USB is connected. Get the path file of a newly connected USB and pass that path file to the directory that needs to be checked for "malicious" files, since I only use a predetermined directory for testing.
- Polish the initial layout. Design a template for the body of the OSA website and add contents to it. Maybe utilize materialize cards. 

## Things learned

- I learned about F3 routing that is used for the Fat-Free framework. 
- I learned how to use AJAX and JSON.
- Long repetitive values can be placed on an array and use repeat for "cleaner" code in Fat-Free.
- Utilize Materialize Framework's flexibility by changing some contents on its prebuilt package. 

## Hardest task done this week

- The simplest task is the hardest. I was assigned to create a new layout (static webpage) for the OSA website and I realized how hard it is to both design and implement. I solved the task by using Materialize instead of using native html and css since Materialize supports a lot of predefined functions. Sir Czar John helped me by making comments that can improve the layout I am designing, like improvements for user-friendliness and ease of use. I learned that it is good to ask for other's opinions since it will improve your work most of the time. I also learned how to properly utilize the Materialize Framework.
