# July Week 5

## Todo

- Create an approval system that allows the admin to set the valid uploaded picture from the user as the uploader's profile picture.

## Done

- Successfully created a system where an admin can approve or reject an uploaded picture. The user can only have one pending picture. If the user uploaded another picture, the old is overwritten by the new. The uploaded file name is randomized for security purposes. If approved, the uploader is notified that the picture is approved and the picture is set as the user's profile picture. If reject, the picture is moved to the rejected folder. Previously rejected pictures are loaded on the admin approval page. Hours done: 20

## To be done

- None

## Things learned

- File uploading and manipulation.

## Hardest task done this week

- File manipulation is hard since files in the system needs to be moved from folder to folder and renamed.
